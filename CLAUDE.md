# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Lekh is a minimal writing website hosted on Vercel where users can write and save content to Supabase. The focus is on simplicity - light, smart implementation with no fancy UI, just a simple text editor.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Simple web interface with text editor
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Database**: Supabase for content storage
- **Philosophy**: Minimal implementation, no error handling, focus on core functionality

## Development Commands

The project is currently in early stages. Common commands will be added as the tech stack is established (likely Next.js for Vercel deployment).

## Key Implementation Notes

- Prioritize simplicity over features
- No complex error handling required
- Keep UI minimal and functional
- Direct integration with Supabase for content persistence
